# Aegis AI &middot; Supplier Risk Intelligence API

Aegis AI is an AI-native third-party risk investigation layer. It turns fragmented public
information into an evidence-backed intelligence object that an enterprise AI
agent can consume before onboarding, procurement, or investment decisions.

**Live demo:** <https://supplier-intelligence-api-1062146216736.us-central1.run.app>

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env                                 # then set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up -d                                 # PostgreSQL (optional, see below)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open <http://localhost:8000> for the demo UI, or <http://localhost:8000/docs>
for the OpenAPI console.

Run the three demo investigations end to end against live sources:

```bash
python -m scripts.demo
```

Run the offline test suite (no network, no database):

```bash
python -m pytest tests -q
```

### It runs without PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the intended datastore. If `DATABASE_URL` is unreachable at
startup, the app logs a warning and falls back to a local SQLite file at
`data/supplier_intel.db` with an identical schema, so the demo works on a
machine with nothing installed. Set `ALLOW_SQLITE_FALLBACK=false` to hard-fail
instead. `GET /api/v1/health` reports which backend is live.

### It runs without any paid API key

| Missing key | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Report is composed deterministically from the same evidence instead of by Claude. Everything else is unchanged. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Embeddings fall back to `sentence-transformers` if installed, else a pure-python hashed char-ngram vectorizer. Entity resolution never requires a paid API. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | The Strategy board serves curated sample decisions instead of running the question live. Falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` if that's set instead. |
| `COURTLISTENER_API_TOKEN` | Litigation is reported as a **coverage gap**, not as "no litigation". |

---

## The API

```
POST /api/v1/supplier/investigate
```

```json
{ "name": "ABC Manufacturing Ltd", "country": "United States", "website": "https://example.com" }
```

Returns `supplier`, `entity_resolution`, `ownership`, `sanctions`,
`adverse_media`, `litigation`, `risk`, `evidence`, `agent_summary`,
`sources_consulted`, and `duration_seconds`.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/supplier/investigate` | Run an investigation |
| `GET /api/v1/investigations` | Recent investigations |
| `GET /api/v1/investigations/{id}` | Replay a stored intelligence object |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/ofac/refresh` | Force a re-download of the SDN list |
| `GET /api/v1/crew/roster` | The ten specialist agents and their task order |
| `POST /api/v1/crew/trace` | Replay the agent crew against an investigation object |
| `GET /api/v1/health` | Backend, embedding mode, SDN size |

---

## Data sources

All five are live. Nothing is mocked.

| Source | Used for | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OFAC** | Sanctions screening | Full SDN list (~39,500 primary names + AKAs) downloaded, flattened into the database, and indexed in memory. Screening is local. |
| **SEC EDGAR** | US identity, filings, officers | Officers are the reporting owners parsed out of recent **Form 4** filings, with their stated officer title or director flag. Throttled under SEC's 10 req/s limit; every request carries the contact User-Agent SEC requires. |
| **GLEIF** | Legal identity, ownership | LEI, official legal name, jurisdiction, registered address, plus direct and ultimate parent relationships. |
| **GDELT** | Adverse media | Company name AND risk vocabulary, last 24 months, headline-scored for severity. |
| **CourtListener** | Litigation | Federal RECAP dockets. Degrades to an explicit coverage gap without a token. |

`OpenCorporates` and `VirusTotal` are **mocked** pending paid access. They are
flagged `"mocked": true` in the response, excluded from scoring, and the agent
prompt forbids citing them.

Every upstream response is cached in the database, so repeat investigations are
near-instant. Observed cold run: ~35s. Warm run: **under 7s**, against a 60s
target.

---

## Entity resolution

The highest-priority component, and the part that is not commodity data.

```
Raw entity -> Normalization -> Feature extraction -> Similarity -> Confidence -> Match
```

**Normalization** strips the noise registries disagree on: accents, punctuation,
dotted initialisms (`S.A.` -> `sa`), ~60 legal-form suffixes across
jurisdictions (`LLC`, `Ltd`, `GmbH`, `Sdn Bhd`, ...), and stopwords. So
`ABC Manufacturing LLC`, `ABC Manufacturing Ltd.` and `ABC Manufacturing GmbH`
all collapse to `abc manufacturing`.

**Five features**, each contributing only when both sides supply data:

| Feature | How it is computed |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Blend of Levenshtein ratio, Jaro-Winkler, and Jaccard token overlap. Both implemented in pure Python, not hidden behind a dependency. Scored against the legal name *and* every alias; best wins. |
| Embedding | Cosine over name + aliases + description. OpenAI, local MiniLM, or hashed char-ngram. |
| Address | Country match, refined by street-token overlap. |
| Website | Registrable domain, with partial credit for subdomains. |
| Ownership | Shared executives — **cross-source only**. |

**Confidence is never hardcoded.** Weights are renormalized over the features
that actually fired, so a match backed by name + website + ownership is scored
on those three rather than diluted by fields nobody published. Every response
carries the full breakdown and the weights used:

```json
"selected": {
  "name": "Apple Inc.", "confidence": 0.88,
  "confidence_breakdown": { "name": 1.0, "embedding": 0.56, "address": 1.0 },
  "weights_used": { "name": 0.533, "embedding": 0.267, "address": 0.2 },
  "explanation": "SEC record 'Apple Inc.' scored on: name 1.00 (w=0.53), ..."
}
```

Rejected alternatives are returned too, so an agent can see *why* one entity was
chosen over the similar ones.

One subtlety worth calling out: ownership overlap is only counted when the
corroborating officers come from a **different source** than the record being
scored. Scoring a record against its own officer list hands every candidate a
free 1.0 and inflates every confidence equally — which is exactly what it did
before it was fixed.

---

## Risk engine

Explainable rules, no ML model. Weights are flat and match the documented table
exactly:

| Signal | Points |
| --- | --- |
| OFAC sanctions match | 100 (scaled by match strength) |
| Litigation found | 30 |
| Adverse media | 20 (scaled by worst-allegation severity) |
| Identity unverified | 25 (scaled by confidence shortfall) |
| Ownership complexity | 15 |

Bands: `low` <30, `medium` 30-54, `high` 55-79, `critical` 80+.

Two deliberate modelling choices:

- **Litigation does not scale with docket count.** Docket volume tracks company
  size far more than company risk — Badger Meter, a mid-cap water-meter maker,
  has 166 federal dockets. Counting volume would put every large supplier in the
  top band. The count stays visible in the description and evidence for a human
  to weigh.
- **A source that failed is a coverage gap, not a clean bill of health.** If
  CourtListener cannot be reached, the response says so and adds risk, rather
  than reporting zero litigation.

`raw_score` is preserved alongside the capped `score` so the arithmetic stays
auditable.

---

## The evidence layer

Every investigation returns a flat, citable `evidence` array (`E1`, `E2`, ...)
carrying source, URL, and description. The agent prompt requires every
conclusion to cite evidence IDs and to write "No evidence available" rather than
infer. Claude receives only the evidence payload — it never fetches anything and
is explicitly told not to introduce outside facts. The response is constrained
by a JSON schema via structured outputs, so the shape is guaranteed.

---

## Demo companies

```bash
python -m scripts.demo
```

| | Company | Demonstrates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Kesko Oyj (Finland) | Clean: verified via LEI, no sanctions, no litigation, no adverse media, risk 0 / low |
| 2 | Wells Fargo & Company | Risk positive: real federal dockets and negative coverage found |
| 3 | ABC Manufacturing | Entity resolution: no exact registrant exists, so the system returns `probable`/`unverified` with the scored alternatives it rejected, instead of guessing |

Demo 1 is deliberately not a US public company. Every large US registrant is
party to federal litigation, so "clean" can only be demonstrated on an entity
that genuinely has none — which is itself a finding about what this data can and
cannot tell you.

## The interface

Three stages, following the workflow an analyst actually uses. Clean, light
theme with a left-hand filter rail on the dashboard.

**1 &middot; Subject intake.** Organization or individual. Name, aliases, date of
birth, address, city, country, registration number, website. Only the name is
required; everything else sharpens entity resolution and suppresses false
positives. A **sample dataset** loads three fictional subjects instantly with no
live calls (see below).

**2 &middot; Risk dashboard.** KPI tiles, a category distribution chart, and adverse
media tagged against five top-level risk categories:

| Category | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| Financial Crime | money laundering, fraud, embezzlement, bribery, insider trading |
| Legal & Reputational Risk | lawsuits, class actions, misconduct, scandal, cover-ups |
| FINRA & Regulatory Bodies | FINRA/SEC enforcement, censure, consent orders, penalties |
| Terrorism & Serious Crime | terrorism financing, trafficking, organised crime, indictments |
| Sanctions & Watchlists | OFAC/SDN, embargoes, designations, watchlists |

A left filter rail carries the five categories (with counts and colour
swatches), a media-objectivity filter (Factual / Mixed / Polarized) and a
severity toggle. All filters compose live.

### Media bias analysis

The dashboard's distinctive feature: every article is scored for **objectivity**,
so sensationalist coverage can be discounted rather than counted at face value.
A transparent lexicon-and-rule model flags sentences carrying loaded/emotional
language, unverified attribution ("sources say", "reportedly"), opinion asserted
as fact, absolutes, and charged reporting verbs. Each article is labelled
Factual, Mixed or Polarized, and the bias table highlights the exact words that
triggered each flag inside the article body. A "show only flagged lines" toggle
collapses each article down to just its biased sentences. It is a lexicon model,
not an ML classifier — every flag points at the words that caused it, which is
what makes it defensible.

### Sample dataset (offline)

Because the live sources are slow (cold-start OFAC download, GDELT rate limits),
a curated demo dataset lets the whole application run instantly:

- Three **fictional** subjects — Northwind Trading Co., Meridian Capital
  Partners, Halcyon Logistics Ltd. Real companies are never given fabricated
  allegations.
- 35 pre-authored adverse-media articles spanning all five categories, with a
  deliberate spread of factual, mixed and polarized bias so the objectivity
  filter has something to separate.
- Full investigation objects (identity, sanctions, litigation, ownership,
  Form 4 transactions, graphs) assembled through the **same** taxonomy, bias
  analyzer and risk engine a live run uses.

`GET /api/v1/demo/subjects` lists them; `GET /api/v1/demo/investigate/{id}`
returns a complete investigation.

**3 &middot; Network drill-down.** Three force-directed graphs:

| Graph | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| Entity resolution | Query at the centre, every candidate scored around it. Click a node for its per-feature breakdown and the weights used - this is the "why this one and not that one" view. |
| Ownership network | Officers, directors and corporate parents of the resolved entity. |
| Transaction network | Insiders trading against the issuer, sized by filing count and coloured by net direction. |

The layout is ~30 lines of force-directed simulation rather than a charting
library, so the page stays dependency-free and works offline.

**4 &middot; Agent crew.** The same investigation, told as the ten-specialist
compliance crew that produced it. This is the [CrewAI][crewai] "supplier third
party risk intelligence" crew ported into the app: each agent keeps its original
brief (Name Variant, Corporate Identity, Adverse Media, Litigation, Sanctions,
Beneficial Ownership, Sentiment, Risk Synthesis, and the Email Alerting
specialist, orchestrated by the Lead Investigator) and is re-grounded on this
platform's live sources and deterministic engines instead of an LLM + web-search
loop. The view animates the crew running in sequence and then shows, per agent,
the **real** finding it produced - status, headline, metrics and the crew tools
vs. live source that powered it. A failed source surfaces as that agent's
coverage gap, exactly as the original crew's lead investigator logged it. The
per-agent breakdown is served by `POST /api/v1/crew/trace`, so an external agent
can consume the same structure.

### On the transaction graph

**These are real filed transactions, not simulated payment flows.** We have no
payments data and do not invent any. The transaction network is built from
**SEC Form 4** filings - reported securities transactions by named insiders,
carrying date, transaction code (open-market purchase, sale, grant, option
exercise, tax withholding, gift), share count and price - parsed from the XML
documents already fetched for officer names. Non-US entities have no Section 16
filing obligation, so the graph is empty for them and says so.

### Screening an individual

Supplying a date of birth changes the outcome rather than decorating it. A name
hit whose DOB corroborates stays at 100/critical; a hit whose listed DOB
conflicts is demoted to 70/high and labelled a likely namesake for manual
review. It is not cleared outright, because aliases and incomplete records
exist.

Name matching compares token-sorted forms as well as the given order, because
sanctions lists write people surname-first (`NASRALLAH, Hasan`) while users type
them forename-first. Without that, an exact match scored 0.67 and was missed
entirely.

---

## Deployment

### Google Cloud Run (what the live demo runs on)

```bash
gcloud run deploy supplier-intelligence-api \
  --source . --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated \
  --memory 1Gi --timeout 300 \
  --set-env-vars "DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:////tmp/supplier_intel.db,USER_AGENT=YourApp/0.1 (you@example.com)"
```

**Expect ~40s per request on this setup, against ~1-6s locally.** Cloud Run's
`/tmp` is per-instance and in-memory, so an instance that has just started has
an empty database and re-downloads the 5.6 MB SDN list before it can screen.
The architecture assumes a shared PostgreSQL instance; without one, the OFAC
cache cannot outlive a container. Two ways to fix it:

- Point `DATABASE_URL` at any managed PostgreSQL (Neon, Supabase and Render all
  have free tiers). The OFAC list and the HTTP cache then persist across
  instances and requests drop back to a few seconds.
- Or `--min-instances 1` to keep one warm instance, which trades a small
  ongoing cost for latency.

### Render (provisions PostgreSQL for you)

`render.yaml` is a complete blueprint. In the Render dashboard: **New ->
Blueprint -> select this repo**. It creates the web service and a free
PostgreSQL instance and wires `DATABASE_URL` automatically; you supply
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at deploy time so it never enters the repository.

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t supplier-intel .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env supplier-intel
```

> The live demo has no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, so it serves the deterministic
> report. Add one with
> `gcloud run services update supplier-intelligence-api --update-env-vars ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`
> and Claude takes over with no other change.

## Known limits

- **Adverse media precision** is the weakest link. The filter requires every
  token of the company name in the headline and drops automated market-wire
  copy (analyst ratings, price targets, stake changes), but a single-token name
  like "Apple" still admits articles where the company is mentioned rather than
  accused. Headline-only tagging is a blunt instrument — article-body scoring
  would be the next improvement.
- **The transaction graph is US-only**, since Form 4 is a Section 16
  obligation. There is no payments or invoice data in this system and none is
  simulated.
- **GDELT rate-limits aggressively** (one request per ~5s per IP) and will
  intermittently return no articles under load.
- **Officer extraction is US-only**, since it depends on SEC Form 4. Non-US
  suppliers resolve identity and ownership via GLEIF but return no executives.
- **OpenCorporates and VirusTotal are mocked** and excluded from scoring.

"""Curated demo dataset - lets the whole application run instantly, offline.

The live sources are slow (cold-start OFAC download, GDELT rate limits), so this
provides three fictional subjects with pre-authored adverse media, litigation,
ownership and insider-transaction fixtures. Adverse-media categories and bias
scores are computed by the real taxonomy and bias analyzer, so the demo
exercises the same code paths a live investigation would.

Every entity here is invented. Real companies are never given fabricated

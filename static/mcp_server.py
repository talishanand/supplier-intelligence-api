"""Aegis MCP server.

Exposes the Aegis investigate_supplier endpoint as an MCP tool so any
MCP-compatible agent (Claude Code, Codex, and others) can screen an entity and
receive the full evidence-backed intelligence object.

Run it:
    pip install "mcp[cli]" httpx
    AEGIS_URL=https://your-aegis-host python mcp_server.py

Then register it with your agent (see the "API & MCP" tab in the Aegis UI).
